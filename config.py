I need a quantitative plan with a list of step by step actions:\nFor example, if you choose 'Move' action, please give me <'Move', '(x,y,z)('Position of the destination')'>;\nIf you choose 'Grab', please give me <'Grab', 'name of the gameobject you want to grab'>;\nIf you choose 'Trigger', please give me <'Trigger', 'name of the gameobject you want to trigger', 'how to trigger the gameobjects',  'how many times you need to trigger to ensure code coverage'>;\nIf you choose 'Transform', please give me <'Transform', 'name of the gameobject you want to transform', 'detailed position you want to transform to ensure code coverage'>;\nAfter you provide me sequence of action list, please give me list of expecting feedbacks to check after we perform the test. Here, please provide me with feedbacks that can easily be detected by our test engineers of multimodal feedback, such as vision and sound. For example, Action: <'Trigger', 'button 1'>; Feedbacks:<'Gameobject n', 'Status: Active'>."

And the transform component is used to store and manipulate the position, rotation and scale of the object. Please specify that the Monobehavior component in the scene file I provided is the settings of the script file attached to the game objects we want to test. Please read the scene settings below and finalize the quantative conditions of your detailed plan based on the scene file.\n"
